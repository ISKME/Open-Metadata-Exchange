respecful issues and pull requests.

## venv
To isolate this project from other projects that use Python, we encourage you to create
a [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with the commands:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable .
```

## pre-commit
We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to format, lint, and test files in this
project so we strongly encourage contributors to:
```bash
uv tool install pre-commit  # or brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Docker Desktop
This project requires that a current version of `Docker Desktop` is properly installed.

## Starting from scratch
Start by creating your own `fork` of the `Open-Metadata-Exchange` GitHub repository.
Substitute your GitHub username in the steps below: `<your_GitHub_username>`
* Go to https://github.com/<your_GitHub_username>/Open-Metadata-Exchange.
* If that page already exists then you already have your own fork.
* If that page does not exist, go to https://github.com/ISKME/Open-Metadata-Exchange and click the `Fork` button in the upper right of the page.

Now let's switch to your terminal to create a local directory where you can make changes and submit those changes as pull requests.
* `git clone https://github.com/<your_GitHub_username>/Open-Metadata-Exchange` will make a local copy of your fork.  Make sure you use `<your_GitHub_username>`!!
* `cd Open-Metadata-Exchange`  # Going inside this new directory is important.
* `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ISKME/Open-Metadata-Exchange`  Make sure you use `ISKME`.
* `git remote -v` to ensure that `origin` is your fork and that `upstream` is the ISKME repo.

% `git remote -v`  # Should look like thisâ€¦
```
origin	https://github.com/<your_GitHub_username>/Open-Metadata-Exchange (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/<your_GitHub_username>/Open-Metadata-Exchange (push)
upstream	https://github.com/ISKME/Open-Metadata-Exchange (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/ISKME/Open-Metadata-Exchange (push)
```
Now you can make changes to your fork (origin) and then push those changes to ISKME (upstream) for review.

You should perform the `pre-commit` steps above to ensure some local testing before your work gets reviewed.
