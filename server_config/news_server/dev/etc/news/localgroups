##  Put your local newsgroups, along with their descriptions,
##  in this file (formatted like the newsgroups file) if you want
##  them to be recognized by docheckgroups.  They would otherwise
##  be mentioned for removal.
##
##  There is no need to put here local newsgroups of hierarchies
##  for which no checkgroups control messages are sent (unless
##  you manually process checkgroups texts for them).
##
##  Lines beginning with a hash sign (#) are not taken into account.
##
##  See the docheckgroups man page for more information.

#comp.group.to.add	An additional local newsgroup in comp.*.
#comp.other.group	Another local newsgroup in comp.*.
