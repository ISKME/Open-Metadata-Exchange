# Open Metadata Exchange plugins
An OME plugin defines how OME imports and publishes metadata from an Open Education Resources system.

`ome_plugin.py` provides the base class that each plugin should inherit from.

Each OME plugin must define one or more:
* `mimetypes` so that its json data can be recognized in InterNetNews articles.
* `newsgroups` so its metadata can be published to and subscribes from those InterNetNews groups.

`server/get_ome_plugins.py` enables inspecting all plugins to access `mimetypes`, `newsgroups`, or functions.

Each OME plugin should be composed of at least three code files.
* `plugin.py`: Defines `mimetypes`, `newsgroups`, and a `make_metadata_card()` function that translates the Open Education Resources system's data into an OME EducationalResource.
* `models.py`: generated by Pydantic tools to make it fast and reliable to import metadata.
* `bulk_import.py`: Utilities to convert data directly from APIs into OME EducationalResources.

> [!NOTE]
> Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) is currently the most advanced plugin so it is the one to study and innovate on.
> Open Library is an example of dealing linked metadata where one API call accesses a Work (e.g. book) and a second API call is required to access linked metadata about that Work's Authors.

`bulk_import.py` can probably be merged into the `plugin.py` file but for now innovation can be faster if they are separate files.

`models.py` is mostly generated by Pydantic tools but the prefix and suffix code is useful documentation and allows single file testing to ensure all is working smoothly.
