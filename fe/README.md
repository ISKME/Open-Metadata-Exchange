# FE: Vuetify (Default)

This is the official scaffolding tool for Vuetify, designed to give
you a head start in building your new Vuetify application. It sets up
a base template with all the necessary configurations and standard
directory structure, enabling you to begin development without the
hassle of setting up the project from scratch.
