** TODO Docker restarts are not graceful.
   `docker compose up`, followed by, Ctrl-C, followed by `docker
   compose up` fails. You have to run docker `compose rm nntp-server`
   before you can successfully run `docker compose up`.

** TODO Templatize the nntp server config files so that we can populate it
   from environment variables to docker-compose.yml to the config
   file.
